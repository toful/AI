Artificial Intelligence exercises carried out during the AI subject, URV
* **Informed Search**
* **Checkers Game**

## Informed Search
Studying the different ways to find a path for moving as fast as we can in a different highs map.

There are some diferent algorithms implemented:
* Breadth Uninformed Search
* Depth Uninformed Search
* Best First Algorithm
* A* Algorithm

Some heuristic functions have also been implemented.

The map is initialized from a text file. The different positions in each line are parsed by a comma, and each position has a single value ( 0 - MAX_INT indicates the hight in that positon and -1 indicates a wrong positon (a cliff) ). Here there is an example:
```
1, 0, -1, 1, 3, 2, 3, 4, 3, 1
2, 1, -1, 2, 4, 2, 2, 4, 2, 2
5, 3, -1, 2, 3, 2, -1, 3, 3, 3
3, 3, 1, 3, 4, 3, -1, 1, 2, 2
2, 2, 2, 3, 6, 4, -1, 1, 2, 1
-1, -1, -1, -1, 3, 3, -1, 0, 2, -1
-1, -1, -1, -1, 2, 4, -1, 2, 2, -1
2, 3, 4, 3, 1, 3, -1, 3, 2, -1
3, 5, 6, 5, 2, 3, -1, 5, 3, -1
5, 6, 7, 6, 4, 4, -1, 6, 4, 5
```
We can move in an horizontal or vertical way. The moving time for each step will be:
* 1 + ( the heights difference  between the destination and the origin ), if the difference is positive or 0.
* 1/2 unit, if the difference is negative.
* We can not move to a position with cliff (-1).

## Checkers Game
Simple version of the checkers game with artificial intelligence.

The algorithms implemented are:
* MiniMax
* Alpha-Beta

The game is played in a 8x8 board with 12 tokens each player (RED and WHITE).

### Rules
* The white player starts
* Tokens can only go forward 1 position diagonally
* Tokens can also go forward 2 positions jumping one token of the other player and if the destination position is empty
* You have to move a token every turn if its possible
* When a token arrives at the other side of the board, it becomes a dame (it cannot be moved)
* Game ends when no player can't move any token
* Wins the player with a higher number of dames (if both players have the same number of dames, wins the player with more tokens)
